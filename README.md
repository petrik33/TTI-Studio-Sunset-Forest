# Sunset Forest

In the game your task is to defend crystal from enemies spawned from both sides of the map.
It will take 3 waves to do that (plus half a wave as a little tutorial) but don't think it's over then.
We tried to design our game as a little yet reach experience,
so wave-defense is followed by the diligently made boss fight.
We hope you enjoy the landscapes of our mesmerizing Sunset Forest throughout your story here.

## Controls

### Basics:

* WASD/Arrow-keys for movement
* LMB - Attack
* RMB - Push (has way more applications then it seems to)
* Space - Jump (and again to double-jump, btw you can attack in air)
* Shift - Dash (backwards, if pressed without movement)
* Tab - Open Bestiary (when the corresponding button pops up in the upper-left corner of your screen)

### Configurable controls:

* S - Interaction
* QWER - Skills

To Skip Tutorial: if you go to the right side you will find a stone burriend in the ground. Jump near it, when you fall down it will pop up, while it's in the air press your Right Mouse Button so you push the stone.

To skip whatever content of cutscene use Space/Enter/LMB.

P.S. Actually you can also turn the laptop mode to configure attack and push from mouse buttons to keys

## Additional Notes

*Have a nice game! All Aboard for Funtime! (Totally unrelated Iggy Pop reference)*
